## 🧠 What This Repo Is All About

This repo is a sandbox of networking experiments built using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It contains several `.pkt` files — each representing a different lab or network design — meant to help you learn, practise, or demo core networking concepts hands‑on.

## 📂 What’s Inside

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `2r.pkt` | Computer Networks Lab 2 – basic to intermediate networking exercises |
| `4r.pkt` / `new4r.pkt` | Another network setup — more routing/switching practice |
| `abr.pkt` | — routers, switches, NAT/VLAN/routing setups (my “master lab”) ⚡ |
| `hub.pkt` | Hub & spoke / basic hub‑based network design experiments |
| `l1.pkt` | Layer‑1 level experiments (physical layer / basic connectivity) |
| `lab2.pkt` | Classic lab exercises — good for foundational practice |
| `nat.pkt` | NAT network configuration experiments |
| `vlan routing.pkt` | VLAN + inter‑VLAN routing practice setup |
| `vslm 16.pkt` | Additional network scenario / custom setup for experimentation |

> 💡 **Tip:** Open the `.pkt` files using Cisco Packet Tracer to explore the network topology, device configs, and simulate traffic.

## ✅ Prerequisites

To use this repository effectively, you’ll need:

- Cisco Packet Tracer (v7.x or newer recommended)  
- A computer capable of running Packet Tracer smoothly

Once you have Packet Tracer installed, simply load any `.pkt` file from this repo and explore the network. 🔄
